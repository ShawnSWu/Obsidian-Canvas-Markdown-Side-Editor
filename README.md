# ✨ Canvas MD Side Editor

If you’re a Canvas enthusiast like me, you won’t want to miss this plugin.  
It allows you to open a right-side Markdown editor directly from the **“Big picture”** 🪐 view of your Canvas, so you can ✍️ edit without zooming in.  
With ⚡ live preview and 💾 auto-save, you can format while writing, move smoothly between cards, and keep your thoughts flowing without interruption.

## 🌈 Why this plugin？

Obsidian Canvas is fantastic for visual thinking — but editing Markdown cards directly inside Canvas can feel cramped and clunky.  
You often have to zoom in and out, double-click small cards, and switch focus repeatedly. This breaks the flow of writing.

**Canvas MD Side Editor** was created to fix exactly that.  
It brings the full power of Obsidian's editor to your Canvas view, letting you write comfortably in a side panel, with **live preview**, **auto-save**, and **no context switching**.  

The goal is simple:  
> ✍️ *Write Markdown with the comfort of a full editor, while keeping the “big picture” in sight.* 🪐
